## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

(None — all requirements included in v1)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Custom animations | Keep existing template animations, avoid scope creep |
| Multi-language support | English only for v1 |
| E-commerce functionality | Lead-gen site only, not transactional |
| Custom dashboard/login areas | Static marketing site |
| PromptWatch API integration | Future enhancement, not v1 |
