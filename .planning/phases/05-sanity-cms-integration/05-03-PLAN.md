<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Deploy Sanity Studio</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Deploy Sanity Studio to Sanity's hosted platform:

```bash
# Login to Sanity (will open browser for authentication)
npx sanity login

# Deploy Studio to promptmarketing.sanity.studio
npx sanity deploy
```

The `studioHost: 'promptmarketing'` in sanity.cli.ts configures the subdomain.

After deployment, Studio will be accessible at:
`https://promptmarketing.sanity.studio`

Verify deployment by visiting the URL and confirming:
- Studio loads without errors
- "Blog Post" document type appears in sidebar
- All schema fields are visible when creating new post
  </action>
  <verify>
- `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://promptmarketing.sanity.studio` returns 200
- Browser can access https://promptmarketing.sanity.studio
- Studio shows "Blog Post" in document creation menu

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Seed sample blog posts</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Create 2-3 sample blog posts in Sanity Studio that match the consultancy's voice and demonstrate the CMS workflow.

Use the Sanity CLI to create documents programmatically:

```bash
# Create sample posts via Sanity CLI
npx sanity documents create --dataset production
```

Or create directly in Studio UI with the following content:

**Post 1: "Why Machine Trust Matters More Than Brand Awareness"**
- Category: Relevance Engineering
- Author: Thomas Huijsmans
- Content: 3-4 paragraphs about the shift from brand-first to machine-first visibility, how LLMs evaluate sources, and why structured data matters for AI recommendations.

**Post 2: "The Five Signals LLMs Use to Recommend Your Brand"**
- Category: AI Strategy
- Author: Thomas Huijsmans
- Content: Explain authority signals (backlinks, citations), freshness, entity clarity, schema markup, and topical depth. Practical checklist format.

**Post 3: "From SEO to GEO: What Actually Changes"**
- Category: Prompt Engineering
- Author: Thomas Huijsmans
- Content: Compare traditional SEO vs Generative Engine Optimization. Cover prompt patterns, citation earning, and the long-tail opportunity in agentic search.

Each post should:
- Use proper Portable Text formatting (headings, paragraphs, bold/italic)
- Include a featured image (can use placeholder from Unsplash or existing blog images)
- Have a proper slug (auto-generated from title)
- Be PUBLISHED (not draft) so it appears on the live site

After creating posts, trigger a site rebuild to verify content appears:

```bash
# Build locally to verify
npm run build && npm run preview
```
  </action>
  <verify>
- Sanity Studio shows 2-3 published posts
- `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- `npm run preview` shows blog posts at /blog
- Blog post pages render Portable Text content correctly
  </verify>
  <done>Sample blog posts created in Sanity, visible on built site, demonstrating full CMS workflow</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Sanity Studio deployment and sample blog content:
