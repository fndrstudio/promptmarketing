# Phase 4: Technical SEO & Machine Readability - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Implement llms.txt for AI agent discoverability and comprehensive Schema.org markup (Organization, Service, Article) as proof-of-concept for PromptMarketing's Relevance Engineering practice. Update canonical URLs for production domain.

## Implementation Decisions

### Production Configuration
- Domain: promptmarketing.com
- All canonical URLs point to https://promptmarketing.com
- Sitemap generates with production URLs

### Organization Schema
- Founding year: 2026
- Location: Amsterdam, Netherlands
- Social profiles: LinkedIn only (company page URL TBD)
- Type: ProfessionalService or ConsultingAgency

### Claude's Discretion
- **llms.txt content**: Tone, structure, what services/capabilities to emphasize. Should reflect "Scientific Forest" voice — precise, technical, no guru language
- **llms.txt format**: Follow llms.txt specification, include navigation guidance for AI agents
- **Service schema**: How to structure the 4 pillars (Prompt Intelligence, Relevance Engineering, Agentic Commerce, AI Advertising) as Service types
- **Article schema**: Author info, dates, categories for blog posts — follow standard patterns
- **Schema.org coverage**: Which schemas on which pages, level of detail
- **Technical implementation**: JSON-LD placement, validation approach

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- This is "practicing what we preach" — PromptMarketing's own site should be a showcase of machine readability
- llms.txt should position PromptMarketing for AI agent discovery (potential clients using AI research tools)
- Schema.org markup should be comprehensive enough to validate properly and demonstrate expertise
