  <name>Task 2: Rewrite features data with three service pillars</name>
  <files>src/data/json-files/featuresData.json</files>
  <action>
Replace featuresData.json with three-pillar service content. Use the voice guidelines: scientific, precise, no "guru" language.

Structure: Three groups, each representing a service pillar. 4 features per pillar (reduced from 8 for focused messaging).

Group 1 - "The Diagnostic" / subtitle: "Prompt Intelligence"
Features (icon suggestions from existing set):
1. "Latent Space Mapping" (icon: "chart-bar")
   - "We analyze how AI models perceive your brand by examining the semantic associations in their training data. No guesswork—just observable patterns."
2. "Visibility Scoring" (icon: "trending-up")
   - "Quantify your brand's Selection Rate—how often AI chooses you over competitors when answering user queries about your category."
3. "Primary Bias Detection" (icon: "light-bulb")
   - "Identify the assumptions AI systems make about your brand. Are they accurate? Outdated? We find the gaps between identity and perception."
4. "Competitive Intelligence" (icon: "document-chart-bar")
   - "See where you stand relative to competitors in the AI's knowledge layer. Understand who gets recommended—and why."

Group 2 - "The Architecture" / subtitle: "Relevance Engineering"
Features:
1. "Schema.org Implementation" (icon: "code-bracket")
   - "Structured data is the language AI understands. We build machine-readable architecture that makes your content parseable and trustworthy."
2. "Entity Optimization" (icon: "puzzle-piece")
   - "Strengthen your brand's knowledge graph presence. Clear entity relationships mean consistent AI representation across platforms."
3. "Content Authority Signals" (icon: "document-text")
   - "Establish topical authority through semantic consistency. We align your content with how AI models structure domain expertise."
4. "Technical GEO Foundation" (icon: "server-stack")
   - "From SXO to GEO: we ensure your technical infrastructure supports AI discoverability and semantic interpretation."

Group 3 - "The Transaction" / subtitle: "Agentic Commerce"
Features:
1. "AI Agent Compatibility" (icon: "arrows-right-left")
   - "Prepare for the autonomous economy. We optimize your data for ACP, MCP, and UCP protocols—the handshakes AI agents use to transact."
2. "Data Provenance" (icon: "lock-closed")
   - "Verifiable, trustworthy data is the currency of AI commerce. We establish clear provenance chains that agents can validate."
3. "Choosability Optimization" (icon: "check-circle")
   - "When an AI agent needs to select a vendor, you want to be chosen. We engineer the signals that make you the reliable choice."
4. "Protocol-Ready Infrastructure" (icon: "arrow-path")
   - "Future-proof your digital presence for the agent economy. Our architecture prepares you for transaction protocols that don't exist yet."

Replace onboardingData.json with the PromptMarketing service journey. This explains "How it works" for potential clients.

Update:

Four steps representing the client journey:

- title: "We map your position in the latent space"
- subtitle: "step 01"
- body: [
    "The engagement begins with a comprehensive audit. We analyze how AI models currently perceive your brand—examining entity associations, selection rates, and semantic gaps.",
    "You'll receive a detailed report showing exactly where you stand versus competitors, with quantified visibility scores and specific opportunities for improvement."
  ]
- cta: { label: "Learn about our audit", href: "/contact" }

    "Every recommendation is tied to measurable outcomes. No vague 'best practices'—just engineered solutions for your identified problems."
  ]

    "Our team implements the technical changes—whether that's structured data, content optimization, or knowledge graph integration. We work alongside your development team or handle it entirely.",
    "Everything is documented, validated, and tested against real AI model responses before going live."
  ]
- cta: { label: "Our implementation process", href: "/contact" }

Step 4 - "Measurement"
- id: "step-4"
- index: "04"
- label: "04. Measure"
- color: "#b8860b" (gold accent - matching brand)

- subtitle: "step 04"
- body: [
