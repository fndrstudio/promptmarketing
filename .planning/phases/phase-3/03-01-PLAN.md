# Plan 03-01: Page Content Voice Update

## Metadata
```yaml
phase: 3
plan: 1
title: "Page Content Voice Update"
scope: "Update features, pricing, contact pages and FAQ to PromptMarketing voice"
autonomous: true
parallel_safe: true
depends_on: []
wave: 1
estimated_tasks: 5
files_modified:
  - src/pages/features.astro
  - src/pages/pricing.astro
  - src/pages/contact.astro
  - src/data/json-files/pricing.json
  - src/components/blocks/faq/StickyFaq.astro
```

## Goal
Transform all page content from generic SaaS/startup language to PromptMarketing's "Scientific Forest" voice: engineers-not-gurus, Dutch pragmatism, radical honesty. The pricing model shifts from subscription tiers to consultancy engagements.

## Must Haves

### Truths (verifiable after completion)
- [ ] Zero occurrences of "launch", "startup", "try it for free" language
- [ ] All CTAs point to /contact with consultancy-appropriate text
- [ ] Pricing reflects engagement tiers (Audit, Implementation, Partnership) not monthly subscriptions
- [ ] FAQ addresses GEO/Relevance Engineering questions, not generic SaaS

### Artifacts (files created/modified)
- [ ] `src/pages/features.astro` - Hero/CTA updated
- [ ] `src/pages/pricing.astro` - Hero/CTA updated
- [ ] `src/pages/contact.astro` - Hero/CTA updated
- [ ] `src/data/json-files/pricing.json` - Consultancy engagement model
- [ ] `src/components/blocks/faq/StickyFaq.astro` - GEO-focused questions

### Key Links (routing/navigation)
- [ ] Features CTA → /contact (not /pricing)
- [ ] Pricing CTAs → /contact (not /signup)
- [ ] Contact maintains current structure

## Tasks

### Task 1: Update features.astro content
**File:** `src/pages/features.astro`

Update hero and CTA content to match PromptMarketing voice:

```typescript
// - Hero
const heroData = {
	title: 'The Complete GEO Capability Stack',
	subtitle: 'Our Services',
	text: 'Three integrated disciplines for the AI-mediated market: understand how machines see you, engineer the signals they trust, prepare for autonomous transactions.'
}
// - CTA
const ctaData = {
	title: 'Ready to Become Machine-Readable?',
	text: 'Most brands discover they're invisible to AI—or worse, misrepresented. A GEO Readiness Audit reveals exactly where you stand and what it takes to fix it.',
	buttonLink: '/contact',
	buttonText: 'Request an Audit'
}
```

### Task 2: Update pricing.json to consultancy model
**File:** `src/data/json-files/pricing.json`

Replace SaaS subscription model with consultancy engagement tiers:

```json
{
	"currency": "EUR",
	"billing_toggle": null,
	"note": "All engagements begin with a GEO Readiness Audit.",
	"plans": [
		{
			"id": "audit",

			]
		}
	]
}
```

### Task 3: Update pricing.astro content
**File:** `src/pages/pricing.astro`

Update hero and CTA for consultancy positioning:

```typescript
// - Hero data
const heroData = {
	title: 'Investment Aligned with Outcomes',
	subtitle: 'Engagement Models',
	text: 'No hidden complexity. We scope every engagement to deliver measurable visibility improvements, starting with a diagnostic that tells you exactly where you stand.'
}
// - Brand data
const brandData = {
	title: 'Trusted by forward-thinking brands'
}
// - FAQ data
const faqData = {
	title: 'Common Questions About Working With Us',
	subtitle: 'Engagement FAQ'
}
// - CTA data
const ctaData = {
	title: 'Not Sure Which Engagement Fits?',
	text: 'Every brand's GEO situation is different. Book a 30-minute call to discuss your visibility challenges and we'll recommend the right starting point.',
	buttonLink: '/contact',
	buttonText: 'Schedule a Call'
}
```

### Task 4: Update contact.astro content
**File:** `src/pages/contact.astro`

Update to scientific, audit-focused language:

```typescript
// - Hero data
const heroData = {
	title: 'Start With a Conversation',
	subtitle: 'Get in Touch',
	text: 'Whether you're curious about your AI visibility, ready for an audit, or want to discuss a specific challenge—we're here to help you understand your options.'
}
// - Contact data
const contactData = {
	title: 'Choose the conversation that fits your situation.'
}
// - Brand data
const brandData = {
	title: 'Working with brands who take AI seriously'
}
// - FAQ data
const faqData = {
	title: 'Questions Before We Talk',
	subtitle: 'Quick Answers'
}
// - CTA data
const ctaData = {
	title: 'Want to Join the Team?',
	text: 'We're always looking for specialists who think differently about the intersection of AI, marketing, and technical architecture. If that sounds like you, reach out.',
	buttonLink: '/contact',
	buttonText: 'Send Your Profile'
}
```

### Task 5: Update StickyFaq.astro content
**File:** `src/components/blocks/faq/StickyFaq.astro`

Replace generic SaaS FAQ with GEO-focused questions:

Replace the FAQ items (lines 37-82) with:

```html
<div class="faq__item">
	<h3 class="faq__item__title">What is GEO and why does it matter?</h3>
	<p class="faq__item__text">
		Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is how brands become visible to AI systems—the models that increasingly mediate how people discover and choose products. When someone asks ChatGPT for a recommendation, GEO determines whether you're mentioned, how you're described, and whether you get selected.
	</p>
	<DecorationBorder type="top bottom" style="dashed" />
</div>
<div class="faq__item">
	<h3 class="faq__item__title">How do you measure AI visibility?</h3>
	<p class="faq__item__text">
		We use proprietary diagnostic tools to measure your Selection Rate—how often AI systems choose your brand when answering relevant queries. We also map your position in the model's latent space to understand the semantic associations driving those choices.
	</p>
	<DecorationBorder type="top bottom" style="dashed" />
</div>
<div class="faq__item">
	<h3 class="faq__item__title">What's the difference between SEO and GEO?</h3>
	<p class="faq__item__text">
		SEO optimizes for search engine rankings—getting your pages to appear in Google results. GEO optimizes for AI understanding—ensuring language models accurately represent your brand when generating responses. Both matter, but GEO addresses the shift toward AI-mediated discovery.
	</p>
	<DecorationBorder type="top bottom" style="dashed" />
</div>
<div class="faq__item">
	<h3 class="faq__item__title">How long does a typical engagement take?</h3>
	<p class="faq__item__text">
		A GEO Readiness Audit typically takes 2-4 weeks. Relevance Engineering implementations run 8-12 weeks depending on scope. We provide clear timelines and milestones before any engagement begins—no ambiguity about what you're getting or when.
	</p>
	<DecorationBorder type="top bottom" style="dashed" />
</div>
<div class="faq__item">
	<h3 class="faq__item__title">Do you guarantee results?</h3>
	<p class="faq__item__text">
		We guarantee measurable visibility improvements and rigorous methodology. AI systems are probabilistic—no one can guarantee specific rankings. What we can promise: transparent measurement, honest assessment of what's achievable, and work we stand behind.
	</p>
	<DecorationBorder type="top bottom" style="dashed" />
</div>
```

## Verification

After completing all tasks:

1. **Voice Check**: Grep for banned phrases
   ```bash
   grep -ri "try it for free\|launch your\|startup\|cancel anytime" src/pages src/components src/data
   ```
   Expected: No results

2. **CTA Links**: Verify all CTAs point to /contact
   ```bash
   grep -r "buttonLink" src/pages/features.astro src/pages/pricing.astro src/pages/contact.astro
   ```
   Expected: All show `/contact`

3. **Pricing Model**: Verify no monthly/annual subscription language
   ```bash
   grep -ri "per month\|billed annually\|monthly\|/month" src/data/json-files/pricing.json
   ```
   Expected: No subscription pricing patterns

4. **Visual Check**: Run dev server and verify pages render correctly

## Notes

- The BasicTable component in pricing.astro reads from pricing.json—updating the JSON updates the rendered table
- FAQ content is hardcoded in the component, not from a JSON file
- featuresData.json was already updated in Phase 2—no changes needed there
