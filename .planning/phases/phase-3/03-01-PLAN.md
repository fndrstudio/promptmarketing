# Plan 03-01: Features → How We Work + Delete Pricing

## Metadata
```yaml
phase: 3
plan: 1
title: "Features → How We Work + Delete Pricing"
scope: "Rename features.astro to how-we-work.astro, delete pricing.astro, update content voice"
autonomous: true
parallel_safe: true
depends_on: []
wave: 1
estimated_tasks: 4
files_modified:
  - src/pages/features.astro (rename to how-we-work.astro)
  - src/pages/pricing.astro (delete)
  - src/pages/how-we-work.astro (new, from rename)
  - src/pages/contact.astro (update content)
```

## Goal
Rename features.astro to how-we-work.astro to match navigation structure, delete pricing.astro (SaaS model doesn't fit consultancy), and update page content to PromptMarketing voice. The /how-we-work route is already configured in navigation from Phase 2.

## Must Haves

### Truths (verifiable after completion)
- [ ] /how-we-work route returns 200
- [ ] /features route returns 404 (page no longer exists)
- [ ] /pricing route returns 404 (page deleted)
- [ ] No "Launch", "Try it for free", "startup" language on how-we-work or contact pages
- [ ] All CTAs point to /contact

### Artifacts (files created/modified)
- [ ] `src/pages/how-we-work.astro` - Renamed from features.astro with updated content
- [ ] `src/pages/features.astro` - DELETED
- [ ] `src/pages/pricing.astro` - DELETED
- [ ] `src/pages/contact.astro` - Updated content voice

### Key Links (routing/navigation)
- [ ] /how-we-work works (navigation already points here)
- [ ] CTAs on how-we-work → /contact

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create how-we-work.astro from features.astro with updated content
**File:** `src/pages/how-we-work.astro` (new file)

Create new How We Work page based on features.astro structure but with consultancy voice:

```astro
---
// How We Work Page
// ------------
// Description: Deep dive into the 4-step methodology

// Components
// - Layout
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro'
// - Blocks
import Hero from '../components/blocks/hero/SimpleHeroPrimary.astro'
import BasicFeatures from '../components/blocks/features/StickyBasicFeatures.astro'
import CTA from '../components/blocks/cta/CTAPrimary.astro'

// Content
// - SEO
const SEO = {
	title: 'PromptMarketing | How We Work',
	description:
		'Our four-step methodology: Intelligence, Optimization, Commerce, and Advertising. A systematic approach to making brands visible and trustworthy to AI systems.'
}
// - Hero
const heroData = {
	title: 'Our Four-Step Solution',
	subtitle: 'How We Work',
	text: 'A systematic methodology for the AI-mediated market. We diagnose, architect, prepare, and amplify, turning AI visibility from guesswork into engineering.'
}
// - CTA
const ctaData = {
	title: 'Ready to Start?',
	text: 'Every engagement begins with understanding where you stand. Book a consultation to discuss your AI visibility challenges and explore the right starting point.',
	buttonLink: '/contact',
	buttonText: 'Get in Touch'
}
---

<Layout title={SEO.title} description={SEO.description}>
	<Hero title={heroData.title} subtitle={heroData.subtitle} text={heroData.text} />
	<BasicFeatures />
	<CTA
		title={ctaData.title}
		text={ctaData.text}
		buttonLink={ctaData.buttonLink}
		buttonText={ctaData.buttonText}
	/>
</Layout>
```

### Task 2: Delete features.astro
**File:** `src/pages/features.astro` (delete)

Remove the old features page since it's being replaced by how-we-work.astro:

```bash
rm src/pages/features.astro
```

### Task 3: Delete pricing.astro
**File:** `src/pages/pricing.astro` (delete)

Remove the SaaS pricing page, doesn't fit consultancy model. Contact page handles engagement inquiries:

```bash
rm src/pages/pricing.astro
```

### Task 4: Update contact.astro content voice
**File:** `src/pages/contact.astro`

Update hero and CTA content to scientific, audit-focused language. Find and replace the content variables:

**Update SEO:**
```typescript
const SEO = {
	title: 'PromptMarketing | Contact',
	description:
		'Start a conversation about AI visibility. Book a consultation to discuss your brand\'s position in the AI-mediated market.'
}
```

**Update heroData:**
```typescript
const heroData = {
	title: 'Start With a Conversation',
	subtitle: 'Get in Touch',
	text: 'Whether you're curious about your AI visibility, ready for an audit, or want to discuss a specific challenge, we're here to help you understand your options.'
}
```

**Update ctaData:**
```typescript
const ctaData = {
	title: 'Want to Join the Team?',
	text: 'We're always looking for specialists who think differently about the intersection of AI, marketing, and technical architecture. If that sounds like you, reach out.',
	buttonLink: '/contact',
	buttonText: 'Send Your Profile'
}
```

## Verification

After completing all tasks:

1. **Route Check - How We Work**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:4321/how-we-work
   ```
   Expected: 200

2. **Route Check - Features Gone**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:4321/features
   ```
   Expected: 404

3. **Route Check - Pricing Gone**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:4321/pricing
   ```
   Expected: 404

4. **Voice Check**:
   ```bash
   grep -ri "try it for free\|launch your\|startup" src/pages/how-we-work.astro src/pages/contact.astro
   ```
   Expected: No results

5. **CTA Links**:
   ```bash
   grep "buttonLink" src/pages/how-we-work.astro src/pages/contact.astro
   ```
   Expected: All show `/contact`

## Notes

- Navigation already points to /how-we-work from Phase 2 work
- The BasicFeatures component reads from featuresData.json, that data will be updated in a separate plan (03-04)
- pricing.json can remain for now (unused) or be cleaned up later
- Contact page form functionality unchanged, only content voice updated
