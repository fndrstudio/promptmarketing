## Tasks

### Task 1: Create about.astro page structure
**File:** `src/pages/about.astro` (new file)

Create the About page using existing component patterns from the template:

```astro
---
// About Page
// ------------
// Description: The About page introduces PromptMarketing's team, philosophy, and approach.

// Components
// - Layout
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro'

// - Blocks
import Hero from '../components/blocks/hero/SimpleHeroPrimary.astro'
import CTA from '../components/blocks/cta/CTAPrimary.astro'

// Content
// - SEO
const SEO = {
	title: 'PromptMarketing | About Us',
	description:
		'Meet the Gang of Super Specialists building the future of AI visibility. Based in Amsterdam, working globally on Generative Engine Optimization.'
}
// - Hero data
const heroData = {
	title: 'A Gang of Super Specialists',
	subtitle: 'About Us',
	text: 'We're a collective of deep experts who believe the AI-mediated market rewards precision over promotion. No generalists. No gurus. Just people who know their craft.'
}
// - CTA data
const ctaData = {
	title: 'Interested in Working With Us?',
	text: 'We take on a limited number of engagements to ensure depth over breadth. If you're serious about AI visibility, let's talk.',
	buttonLink: '/contact',
	buttonText: 'Start a Conversation'
}

<Layout title={SEO.title} description={SEO.description}>

					<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
						The shift from search to synthesis is happening now. When people ask AI for recommendations,
						the model doesn't return a list of links, it makes choices. It synthesizes, summarizes, and
						selects. If your brand isn't part of that synthesis, you're invisible.
					</p>
					<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Most marketing agencies haven't noticed. They're still optimizing for algorithms that
						rank pages, not models that understand meaning. We built PromptMarketing because
						someone needs to bridge that gap, with rigor, not hype.

					<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Engineers, not gurus.</strong> We don't sell certainty in an uncertain domain.
						AI systems are probabilistic, anyone claiming guaranteed results is either lying or
						doesn't understand the technology. We offer rigorous methodology, transparent
						measurement, and honest assessment of what's achievable.
					</p>
					<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Specialists, not generalists.</strong> Every person on our team has deep
						expertise in a specific discipline: semantic architecture, knowledge graphs,
						technical SEO, AI systems. We collaborate on projects, each contributing what
						they know best. No mediocre middle.
					</p>
					<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Dutch pragmatism.</strong> We're based in Amsterdam, and we bring that
						directness to everything we do. No inflated promises. No buzzword theater.
						Just clear thinking about hard problems.

					<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Our base of operations is a workspace in Amsterdam where specialists converge
						to solve problems that don't have playbooks yet. Part research lab, part
						strategy room, a place where new ideas get stress-tested before they reach clients.
					</p>
					<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
						The Clubhouse model means we can assemble exactly the right team for each
						engagement. Your project might need a Schema.org architect, a knowledge graph
						specialist, and an AI systems expert, we pull in precisely those people, no padding.

### Task 2: Verify page renders and navigation works
**Manual verification:**

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/about`
3. Verify page renders without errors
4. Check "About Us" link in navigation works
5. Verify CTA button links to `/contact`
6. Test dark mode toggle
7. Check mobile responsive layout

## Verification

After completing all tasks:

1. **Route Check**: Verify /about is accessible
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:4321/about
   ```
   Expected: 200

2. **Content Check**: Verify key phrases present
   ```bash
   grep -l "Gang of Super Specialists\|Amsterdam Clubhouse\|Engineers, not gurus" src/pages/about.astro
   ```
   Expected: src/pages/about.astro

3. **Link Check**: Verify CTA points to /contact
   ```bash
   grep "buttonLink.*contact" src/pages/about.astro
   ```
   Expected: Match found

4. **No Guru Language**: Check for banned phrases
   ```bash
   grep -i "guru\|revolutionary\|game-changing\|disruptive" src/pages/about.astro
   ```
   Expected: Only "gurus" in the context of "not gurus"

## Notes

- Page uses existing Hero and CTA components for consistency
- Custom sections use Tailwind utility classes matching template patterns
- `prose` class from Tailwind Typography for readable text blocks
- Grid layout for values section matches template responsive patterns
- No new components created, uses inline sections to keep scope minimal
