## Metadata
```yaml
phase: 3
plan: 4
title: "Homepage 4-Pillar Update + Footer Cleanup"
scope: "Update featuresData.json to 4 pillars, clean up footer links"
autonomous: true
parallel_safe: true
depends_on: []
wave: 1
estimated_tasks: 3
files_modified:
  - src/data/json-files/featuresData.json (4 pillars)
  - src/data/json-files/footerNavigationData.json (cleanup links)
  - src/pages/index.astro (update hero/CTA text per Layout doc)
```

## Goal
Update the homepage to match the Layout document: 4 pillars (Intelligence, Optimization, Commerce, Advertising) instead of 3, and clean up footer legal links (remove Conditions, point Privacy to /terms). Also update hero messaging to match Layout doc structure.

## Must Haves

### Truths (verifiable after completion)
- [ ] Homepage displays 4 solution cards (Intelligence, Optimization, Commerce, Advertising)
- [ ] Footer legal section only shows "Terms" and "Privacy" (no "Conditions")
- [ ] Both Terms and Privacy links point to /terms
- [ ] Hero section matches Layout doc (~8 word title, pitch subtitle)
- [ ] No broken footer links

### Artifacts (files created/modified)
- [ ] `src/data/json-files/featuresData.json` - Updated to 4 pillars
- [ ] `src/data/json-files/footerNavigationData.json` - Cleaned up legal links
- [ ] `src/pages/index.astro` - Updated hero/CTA content

### Key Links (routing/navigation)
- [ ] Footer Terms → /terms
- [ ] Footer Privacy → /terms (same page)
- [ ] No Conditions link

## Tasks

### Task 1: Update featuresData.json to 4 pillars
**File:** `src/data/json-files/featuresData.json`

Replace the current 3-pillar structure with 4 pillars per Layout document:

```json
[
	{
		"title": "Intelligence",
		"subtitle": "Understand Your Position",
		"features": [
			{
				"title": "Latent Space Mapping",
				"description": "Analyze how AI models perceive your brand by examining semantic associations in their training data. No guesswork, just observable patterns.",
				"icon": "chart-bar"
			},
			{
				"title": "AI Selection Rate",
				"description": "Quantify how often AI systems choose your brand when answering queries in your category. The metric that matters in the generative era.",
				"icon": "trending-up"
			},
			{
				"title": "Competitive Visibility",
				"description": "See where you stand relative to competitors in the AI's knowledge layer. Understand who gets recommended, and why.",
				"icon": "document-chart-bar"
			}
		]
	},
	{
		"title": "Optimization",
		"subtitle": "Engineer Machine Trust",
		"features": [
			{
				"title": "Schema.org Architecture",
				"description": "Structured data is the language AI understands. We build machine-readable architecture that makes your content parseable and trustworthy.",
				"icon": "code-bracket"
			},
			{

				"icon": "puzzle-piece"

			{
				"title": "Content Authority Signals",
				"description": "Establish topical authority through semantic consistency. Align your content with how AI models structure domain expertise.",
				"icon": "document-text"
			}
		]
	},
	{
		"title": "Commerce",
		"subtitle": "Prepare for Autonomous Transactions",
		"features": [
			{
				"title": "AI Agent Compatibility",
				"description": "Prepare for the autonomous economy. Optimize your data for ACP, MCP, and UCP protocols, the handshakes AI agents use to transact.",
				"icon": "arrows-right-left"
			},
			{
				"title": "Data Provenance",
				"description": "Verifiable, trustworthy data is the currency of AI commerce. Establish clear provenance chains that agents can validate.",
				"icon": "lock-closed"
			},
			{
				"title": "Choosability Optimization",
				"description": "When an AI agent needs to select a vendor, you want to be chosen. Engineer the signals that make you the reliable choice.",
				"icon": "check-circle"
			}
		]
	},
	{
		"title": "Advertising",
		"subtitle": "Amplify AI Presence",
		"features": [
			{
				"title": "AI-Native Campaigns",
				"description": "Advertising strategies designed for AI-mediated discovery. Reach audiences through the channels AI systems prioritize.",
				"icon": "megaphone"
			},
			{
				"title": "Prompt-Optimized Creative",
				"description": "Content that performs in AI contexts. From search to synthesis, ensure your messaging translates to AI recommendations.",
				"icon": "sparkles"
			},
			{
				"title": "Performance Measurement",
				"description": "Track what matters: AI mention rate, recommendation frequency, selection conversion. Metrics for the generative era.",
				"icon": "chart-pie"
			}
		]
	}
]
```

### Task 2: Clean up footer legal links
**File:** `src/data/json-files/footerNavigationData.json`

Update the copyright.legal array to remove Conditions and point Privacy to /terms:

Find:
```json
"legal": [
	{ "label": "Terms", "href": "/terms" },
	{ "label": "Conditions", "href": "/conditions" },
	{ "label": "Privacy Policy", "href": "/privacy" }
]
```

Replace with:
```json
"legal": [
	{ "label": "Terms", "href": "/terms" },
	{ "label": "Privacy", "href": "/terms" }
]
```

### Task 3: Update index.astro hero and CTA content
**File:** `src/pages/index.astro`

Update to match Layout document structure (shorter hero title, clearer pitch):

**Update heroData:**
```typescript
const heroData = {
	title: 'Search Marketing for the Generative Era',
	subtitle: 'Prompt Marketing',
	buttonLink: '/contact',
	buttonText: 'Get a Strategy Audit'
}
```

**Update ctaData:**
```typescript
const ctaData = {
	title: 'Ready to Dominate the New Search Era?',
	text: 'Most brands discover they're invisible to AI, or worse, misrepresented. A GEO Readiness Audit reveals exactly where you stand.',
	buttonLink: '/contact',
	buttonText: 'Let\'s Talk'
}
```

**Update brandData:**
```typescript
const brandData = {
	title: 'Trusted by innovative brands'
}
```

## Verification

After completing all tasks:

1. **4 Pillars Check**:
   ```bash
   grep -c '"title":' src/data/json-files/featuresData.json | grep "4"
   ```
   Expected: 4 top-level sections

2. **Pillar Names Check**:
   ```bash
   grep -E '"title": "(Intelligence|Optimization|Commerce|Advertising)"' src/data/json-files/featuresData.json | wc -l
   ```
   Expected: 4

3. **Footer Legal Check**:
   ```bash
   grep -A5 '"legal"' src/data/json-files/footerNavigationData.json
   ```
   Expected: Only Terms and Privacy, both pointing to /terms

4. **No Conditions Link**:
   ```bash
   grep -i "conditions" src/data/json-files/footerNavigationData.json
   ```
   Expected: No results

5. **Visual Check**: Run dev server, verify homepage shows 4 pillars and footer has clean legal links

## Notes

- The StickyBasicFeatures component reads from featuresData.json automatically
- If the component only displays 3 sections, may need to verify component logic handles 4 sections
- Icons used for new Advertising pillar: megaphone, sparkles, chart-pie (verify these exist in icon set)
- Footer Privacy and Terms pointing to same /terms page is intentional (single legal page)
- Consider creating a unified /legal or /terms page that covers both if not already present
