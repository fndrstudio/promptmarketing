**1\. Design Briefing: Visualizing the "Executing Consultancy"**

The objective is to move from "abstract AI" to a **Functional Operating System**. Every visual element must look like it belongs in a high-stakes technical audit.

### **Brand Essence & Direction**

* **The Service Journey:** The design must visually transition through our three phases: **Diagnostic** (Intelligence) → **Architecture** (Engineering) → **Transaction** (Commerce).  
* **The "Scientific Forest" Aesthetic:** \* **Obsidian Forest (Primary):** Represents the "Latent Space", the deep, dark, and complex neural network where brand associations live.  
  * **Electric Lime (Accent):** Represents the "Prompt Cursor" and "Relevance Signals", the sparks of data that guide AI models.  
* **Key Dichotomy (The Typographic Rule):** \* **The Serif (Human/Story):** Used for strategy, vision, and the "Why." It represents our authority as consultants.  
  * **The Sans/Mono (Machine/Data):** Used for KPIs, technical specs, and protocols. It represents our precision as engineers.

### **Logo & Functional Elements**

* **The PM Mark:** Needs to look "constructed." It should feel like a node in a Knowledge Graph, connected, stable, and foundational.  
* **Service Icons:** We need four distinct yet unified icons representing:  
  1. **Prompt Intelligence:** (e.g., A lens scanning a vector cluster).  
  2. **Relevance Engineering:** (e.g., A blueprint or a structural node-graph).  
  3. **Agentic Commerce:** (e.g., A protocol handshake or an API gateway).  
  4. **Prompt Advertising:** (e.g., A targeted beam within the forest).

**2\. Tone of Voice: "Scientific & Radically Honest"**

Our voice is the **Priming** that makes humans trust our **Proving**.

### **The Framework Voice Pillars**

| Pillar | What it sounds like | Visual Equivalent |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Diagnostic (Intelligence)** | "We map the latent space to find where your brand is misaligned." | High-contrast heatmaps; vector scatter plots. |
| **Architectural (Engineering)** | "We build machine-readable infrastructure using Schema and entities." | Clean line-art; blueprint grids; monospaced labels. |
| **Agentic (Commerce)** | "We optimize for the ACP/MCP handshake. The AI executes the buy." | Data flow diagrams; API 'code-snippet' aesthetics. |
| **Contrarian (Dutch Pragmatism)** | "Rankings are a vanishing metric. We measure Selection Rate." | Heavy negative space; bold, serif-based headlines. |

### **Operational Instructions for the Team**

* **The "No-Blue" Mandate:** Reject the "SaaS Blue" standard. We are the "Obsidian Forest", different, deeper, and more specialized.  
* **The KPI Standard:** Never show a "Growth Arrow" without the data to back it up. Use the **Electric Lime** for the metric and the **Serif** for the strategic takeaway.  
* **The "Arena" Photography:** If showing the team, show them in the Amsterdam Clubhouse, actual work, actual screens, actual whiteboards. No staged "pointing at a laptop."

**3\. Visual & Textual Metaphors (The Framework in Action)**

* **The Latent Space Mapping:** Instead of "Market Research," we visualize **"Latent Space Clusters."** Use the Electric Lime to show a brand’s "Selection Rate" rising out of the Obsidian background.  
* **Relevance Engineering BLUEPRINTS:** Treat a website’s technical SEO not as a checklist, but as a **"Machine-Readable Architecture."** Use grid overlays and technical call-outs to show SXO/GEO in action.  
* **The Protocol Handshake:** Visualize **Agentic Commerce** as a literal gateway. It’s the moment the brand’s data meets the AI Agent’s request. This should look like a "Clean API Handshake", minimal, fast, and transactional.  
* **The Dunning-Kruger "Scientific Journey":** Use the "Mount Stupid" analogy in our branding to show we are the adults in the room who understand the complexity of the "Valley of Despair."

**PromptMarketing Strategy Note for the Designer:**

Your goal is to make the client feel like they are looking at a **proprietary technical blueprint** for their brand's future. It should feel expensive, engineered, and "radically honest."
