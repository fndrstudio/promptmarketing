PromptMarketing mission:

**"To empower businesses by operationalizing Relevance Engineering (GEO) and architecting the knowledge layers that ensure brands are understood, trusted, and successfully represented by AI systems."**

# **Website Brief: The PromptMarketing Operating System**

Project: Technical & Visual Web Architecture  
Core Mission: Operationalizing Relevance Engineering (GEO)

## ---

**1\. Design Briefing: The "Interface of Authority"**

The website must function as a proof-of-concept for **Relevance Engineering**. It shouldn't just talk about AI; it should look like it was built to be understood by it.

### **The Digital Mandate**

* **The Transition:** Visualizing the shift from the "Broken Linear Funnel" to the **"Priming vs. Proving Flywheel."**  
* **The Aesthetic:** **"The Scientific Forest."** A deep, dark environment (**Obsidian Forest**) where the only light comes from the data-rich signals of **Electric Lime**.  
* **The Typographic Split:** \* **Serif (The Heart):** Editorial, high-contrast, and authoritative. Used for the strategic narrative.  
  * **Sans/Mono (The Mind):** Technical, precise, and structured. Used for data, protocols, and the "Machine-Readable" layers.

**2\. Core Service Pillars: The "OS" Navigation**

We will structure the site around the three pillars from the **Executive Summary**, using the detailed elaboration style of our first iteration.

### **Pillar 1: Prompt Intelligence (The Diagnostic)**

* **Visual Equivalent:** High-contrast vector maps and "Selection Rate" dashboards.  
* **Function:** This section explains how we analyze the **"Latent Space"** to find the gap between a brand's identity and its digital footprint.  
* **Key Design Element:** A "Live Data" feel. Use the Electric Lime to highlight **Primary Bias** and **Visibility Scores**.

### **Pillar 2: Prompt Optimisation (The Architecture)**

* **Visual Equivalent:** Architectural blueprints, Schema node-graphs, and structured data grids.  
* **Function:** This is the **Relevance Engineering** workshop. It details the transition from Technical Foundation (SXO) to Synthesis (GEO).  
* **Key Design Element:** Grid-based layouts that look like "Machine-Readable" technical specs.

### **Pillar 3: Agentic Commerce (The Transaction)**

* **Visual Equivalent:** API documentation aesthetics and "Protocol Handshake" icons.  
* **Function:** Optimizing for the next economic paradigm—being reliably selected by autonomous AI agents (ACP/UCP/MCP protocols).  
* **Key Design Element:** Clean, fast, and transactional. Focus on "Data Provenance" and "Choosability."

**3\. Site Tone & Functional Requirements**

| Category | Requirement | "Guru" Version (Avoid) | "Scientific" Version (Do) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Hero Section** | **The Engineering Reality** | "We make AI love you." | "Operationalizing Machine Trust." |
| **Social Proof** | **The Data Vault** | Logos of big companies. | Live **Visibility Scores** from the PromptWatch API. |
| **About Us** | **The Arena** | Headshots of people smiling. | Photos of the **Clubhouse**—actual logic on whiteboards. |
| **Lead Gen** | **The Audit** | "Get a free consultation." | "Request a GEO Readiness Audit." |

### **Operational Mandate for the Developer**

* **Performance:** Lightning-fast. A slow site is a failed engineering project.  
* **SEO/GEO:** The site must have perfect Schema.org implementation and an llms.txt file at the root. We are the "Gold Standard" of machine-readability.  
* **Micro-interactions:** Use the Electric Lime for a "Scanning" effect on hover, mimicking an AI agent analyzing an entity.

**4\. Visual & Textual Metaphor: The "Latent Space"**

Instead of a standard "Services" page, we will call it the **"Framework Deployment."** \* **Textual:** Use terms like "Semantic Consistency," "Entity Density," and "Data Provenance."

* **Visual:** Show the connection between the **Obsidian Forest** (the data we organize) and the **Electric Lime** (the clarity we provide to the AI).

**Arjan, does this "Operational OS" version feel more aligned with the mission?** I’ve removed the "Search Confusion" phrasing and replaced it with our commitment to **Relevance Engineering** and **Machine Trust**.

Would you like me to start drafting the specific technical copy for the **Prompt Intelligence** section?
