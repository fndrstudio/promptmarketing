# **THE PROMPT MARKETING MANIFESTO**

### **Version 2.0 | The Code of the "Gang of Super Specialists"**

We are not just an agency. We are an executing consultancy built for the Generative AI era.

The marketing funnel has collapsed. The old rules of SEO are dying. We are the team defining the new rules.

### **1\. PRAGMATIC, HONEST, & OPEN**

We are rooted in Dutch pragmatism. We are down-to-earth and we value directness.

* **Radical Honesty.** We don't hide behind corporate jargon. We are open and transparent with each other and our clients.  
* **No "Black Boxes."** If we don't know the answer, we admit it. Then, we do the work to find it. We don't sell magic; we sell expertise.  
* **Flat & Accessible.** We are a flat organization. There are no ivory towers here. We treat everyone with the same respect, regardless of title.

### **2\. WE ARE ENGINEERS, NOT GURUS**

We reject the title of "Guru." In the face of rapidly evolving LLMs, "Gurus" are usually at the "Peak of Mount Stupid”.

* **The Scientific Approach.** We don't guess; we test. We take an engineering mindset to marketing.  
* **Data over Opinion.** Our strategies are backed by our own proprietary data and tools (like PromptWatch and our Auditor Agents), not gut feelings.

**3\. OUTPUT IS KING**

We are an international team of adults. We do not police hours or inputs.

* **Work from Anywhere.** Whether you are in our Amsterdam "Clubhouse" or working remotely across Europe, you are a first-class citizen of this company.  
* **Results Matter.** We don't care if you work 9-to-5 or irregular hours. We care about the quality of the work and the value delivered to the client.  
* **The Clubhouse.** Our office is a place to connect and collaborate, not a factory for seat-warming.

### **4\. SUPERCHARGING STRENGTHS**

We believe that people excel when they do what they are naturally good at.

* **Strengths over Weaknesses.** We do not manage your weak points; we exploit your strengths. We want you to become the absolute best version of yourself.  
* **The "Super Specialist."** We don't want mediocre generalists. We empower you to go deep into your niche, whether that is Technical SEO, Content Strategy, or AI Automation, and own it completely.  
* **Continuous Growth.** Personal self-development is crucial. We support your journey to master your craft.

### **5\. EVERYONE IS IN THE ARENA**

We are all builders. We are all close to the work.

* **We Are All Billable.** Even the Founder remains 20% billable. This ensures we never lose touch with the reality of the work or the needs of the client.  
* **Automate the Boring.** We use AI agents to do the repetitive heavy lifting so that *you* can focus on high-value strategy and creativity.

### **6\. PARTNERS IN DISCOVERY**

We do not just execute tasks; we partner with our clients on a journey.

* **Co-Innovation.** We invite clients into the lab with us. We explore the new AI frontier together, sharing our learnings and our breakthroughs openly.  
* **Priming & Proving.** We practice what we preach: We build trust with humans (Priming) while building authority with machines (Proving).
