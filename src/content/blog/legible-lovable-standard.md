Marketing strategy is entering a rare moment of reset.

Not because channels are changing — we've lived through that many times before — but because the **mediator between brands and people is changing**. Discovery, comparison and decision-making are increasingly being delegated to AI systems acting on behalf of users.

When that happens, brands are no longer primarily competing for attention.
They are competing for **interpretation** and **selection**.

In a recent and important piece, **Thomas Marzano** articulates this shift through what he calls the **Legible-Lovable standard**: a simple but powerful framing for how brands must operate in an agentic economy.

We believe this framework captures the essence of modern marketing strategy — and it also clarifies why new disciplines are now required.

## The Legible-Lovable standard, explained

The insight at the heart of the Legible-Lovable standard is straightforward:

* If a brand is not **legible to machines**, it does not exist.
* If a brand is not **lovable to humans**, it does not matter.

In an agent-mediated world, both conditions must be met.

AI systems shortlist brands based on what they can read, verify and reason about. Humans ultimately choose based on meaning, emotion and trust. Remove either side, and the system breaks down.

This gives us two foundational elements of marketing strategy in the generative AI era:

1. **Legibility** – being machine-readable, verifiable and interpretable
2. **Lovability** – being emotionally resonant, meaningful and culturally relevant

These are not new ideas.
What *is* new is that they now function as **distinct but interdependent strategic layers**.

## 1. Legibility: the technical foundation of existence

Legibility is not about creativity or storytelling. It is about **whether AI systems can correctly understand and represent your brand**.

Generative AI does not browse the web the way humans do. It synthesises knowledge across entities, relationships, corroboration and trust signals. If a brand cannot be parsed reliably across those dimensions, it will simply be excluded — regardless of how strong it is in the real world.

Legibility includes:

* clear entity definitions and relationships
* structured product and service data
* consistent naming, categorisation and semantics
* verifiable sources, provenance and authority signals

This is where many brands currently struggle — not because their brand strategy is weak, but because their digital foundations were never designed for reasoning systems.

At PromptMarketing, this is where we focus most explicitly. We treat legibility as an **engineering challenge**:

* analysing how AI systems currently interpret a brand
* identifying gaps, ambiguities and misrepresentations
* designing structured, machine-readable foundations
* measuring how often a brand is selected in AI-generated responses

Legibility turns brand intent into something AI systems can actually act on.

## 2. Lovability: the human reason to choose

Lovability is the domain brand strategists know well — purpose, values, identity, narrative and emotional resonance.

Even in an agentic world, this does not disappear. In fact, it becomes more important.

When AI agents evaluate multiple viable options, they optimise for *human preference*. That means they increasingly lean on signals of trust, affinity and emotional alignment — often inferred from prior behaviour, cultural context and collective sentiment.

Lovability is what:

* makes a brand feel right for a person
* creates preference beyond specifications
* sustains trust over time

What *does* change is how lovability must hold up under mediation. Brand meaning is increasingly rendered through AI systems, not just through owned channels. Emotional clarity and consistency therefore need to be strong enough to survive interpretation.

At PromptMarketing, we also support the **Lovable** side of the equation. We help brands build authority in high-signal environments, encourage credible positive mentions, and refine review strategies so that a brand's true strengths are not just visible, but clearly *felt* in how it is represented.

Lovability provides the *why*.
Legibility ensures the *why* is not lost in translation.

## Where marketing strategy often breaks today

Many organisations over-invest in one side and neglect the other.

Some brands are deeply lovable — culturally relevant, emotionally rich — but illegible to machines. They are admired by people, yet absent from AI-generated answers.

Others are highly legible — clean data, strong authority signals — but emotionally flat. They appear, but they are rarely chosen.

This leads to familiar frustration:

* "We have a strong brand, why aren't we showing up?"
* "We rank well, why are AI systems ignoring us?"

The answer is almost always strategic imbalance.

---

## PromptMarketing's role in the equation

PromptMarketing exists to **make brand strategy executable in an AI-mediated world**.

We do not redefine what a brand stands for.
We ensure that what it stands for is:

* correctly understood by AI systems
* consistently represented across generative experiences
* measurably present when decisions are made

In the Legible-Lovable model, we operationalise **Legibility** while supporting the conditions under which **Lovability can convert into selection**.

Without legibility, brand meaning never enters the shortlist.
Without lovability, being shortlisted does not lead to preference.

---

## The strategic takeaway

Marketing strategy in the generative AI era is no longer a single discipline.

It is a **two-part system**:

* one part human, emotional and cultural
* one part technical, structured and machine-readable

The brands that win will not choose between them.
They will connect them.

Because in a world where AI mediates discovery, **existence and meaning are separate problems — and both must be solved**.
