In Q4 2025, I founded PromptMarketing because something fundamental in search had changed.

I've worked in search marketing for my entire professional life. I started my career at Google back in 2006, in the early days of what we now think of as "classic" search. Since then, I've spent nearly two decades deeply involved in search marketing — building strategies, advising brands, and forging close partnerships with many parts of the Google organisation.

At Abovo Maxlead, search marketing was a core pillar of our consultancy offering. Like many in the industry, we evolved alongside Google: from keywords to intent, from links to authority, from mobile-first to experience-first. Search has *always* been in motion.

But what I saw emerging in 2025 was different.

This wasn't another algorithm update.
This was a structural shift.

## From search results to synthesized answers

In 2025, two things started happening at once.

First, Google's SERPs changed dramatically. Not just cosmetically, but conceptually. Answers replaced links. Synthesis replaced ranking.

Second — and even more importantly — user behaviour changed at a breathtaking pace. People didn't just *experiment* with generative AI; they adopted it. ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude — these tools became daily interfaces for discovery, comparison, and decision-making.

Sometimes, even for someone who has lived through every major wave in search, the speed of this change felt almost unbelievable. And the quality of these systems is, frankly, mind-boggling.

But with that quality comes a new reality for brands.

## When AI speaks for your brand, you lose control

In classic SEO, brands competed for visibility. You optimised pages. You ranked links. You fought for clicks.

In generative AI experiences, something far more confronting happens.

The AI doesn't just *surface* your brand — it **interprets** it.

It summarises what you do.
It compares you to competitors.
It benchmarks you.
It recommends — or ignores — you.

For CMOs and brand leaders, this creates a genuine nightmare scenario.

The brand narrative is no longer fully in your hands.
You can't simply "write the message" anymore.
The model decides how you are understood.

And yet, most organisations are flying blind. They don't know:

* how their brand appears inside large language models
* how often they are selected versus competitors
* or what signals influence those outcomes

This is the gap PromptMarketing exists to fill.

## This is not "just SEO"

A question I hear often is:
*"Isn't this just SEO, but with a new label?"*

My honest answer is: **no**.

Generative AI systems are not ranking engines.
They are probabilistic reasoning systems.

They don't return ten blue links.
They synthesize, interpret, and select.

That difference matters — enormously.

These new generative experiences deserve focused attention, new measurement, and a new way of thinking. That's why PromptMarketing is built around four clear pillars:

1. **Intelligence**
   Research and analytics to understand prompt behaviour, benchmark AI visibility, measure Selection Rate, and analyse how LLMs perceive your brand.
2. **Optimisation**
   Relevance engineering: semantic architecture, entity optimisation, structured data, and authority signals designed for machine understanding — not just crawling.
3. **Agentic Commerce**
   Preparing brands for a future where AI agents don't just recommend, but transact — requiring verifiable data, provenance, and protocol readiness.
4. **Generative Engine Advertising**
   What we call Prompt Advertising: preparing brands for paid visibility inside generative AI environments, where intent signals are unprecedented.

Together, these form what we call **PromptMarketing**: a new discipline for AI Search visibility.

## Building PromptMarketing

I officially started the company in early December. I still remember going to the Chamber of Commerce, registering the business, and realising — with genuine excitement — that *PromptMarketing.com* was still available.

That moment felt like a signal.

From there, I began assembling the right people. Not generalists. Not hype merchants. But specialists who deeply understand search, semantics, engineering, AI systems, and enterprise consultancy.

Today, we're a team of six, working together to shape this new discipline. We're refining the proposition, building the methodology, and — most importantly — learning by doing.

Because the truth is: this is uncharted territory.

No one can honestly claim to have all the answers yet. We don't know exactly how every optimisation will play out, or how value will compound over time. That's why we're taking a **scientific, engineering-led approach**: measuring what can be observed, testing hypotheses, and being transparent about uncertainty.

## Looking ahead

PromptMarketing exists to help serious brands navigate a world where AI systems don't just index content — they make choices.

My goal is simple:
to help brands be **understood**, **trusted**, and **selected** in the generative era.

I'm incredibly excited about what lies ahead, and grateful to everyone joining us on this journey — clients, partners, peers, and the wider search community.

This is just the beginning.
